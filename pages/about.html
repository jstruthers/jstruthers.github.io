  <p>
    Want to continue to learn by creating. Love the discipline and focus required for long-term projects.
    Solid understanding of and ability with <b>React</b>, <b>Redux</b>, <b>Meteor</b>, <b>HTML 5</b>, and <b>ECMA Script 6</b>.
    Recently completed an intensive Front End Development boot camp with Bloc.
    Looking for a position where I can work alongside ambitious and driven people. One of the things I like most about the web design community
    is how it embraces and encourages mentorship, collaboration, and the open sharing of ideas.
